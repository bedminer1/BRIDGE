I really like bridge. It has the appeal of 
- being a simple party game like uno
- while strategy can go quite deep with card counting like in blackjack
- expected value calculations like in poker
- bluffing like in mafia where you trick others about your team status

I played it everyday in high school, during breaks, after school. But after graduating, it's been harder to organize sessions. I tried sneaking it into my navy camp once and got caught in like a week lol.

So I built this, first as a singleplayer version just to entertain myself with bots following simple flow charts. 

But I have plans to make it multiplayer to play with friends online, although it still won't be the same as in person of course. Training the bots using machine learning and deep learning techniques is also in the works, hopefully to make brdige bots that are unbeatable (or very hard to beat since bridge is still has an element of luck) like chess bots have become.
