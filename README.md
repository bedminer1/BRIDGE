I really like bridge. It has the appeal of 
- being quite simple at its core like **uno**
- while strategy can go deeper with card counting like in **blackjack**
- expected value calculations like in **poker**
- bluffing like in **mafia** where you trick others about your team status

I played it everyday in high school, during breaks, after school. But after graduating, it's been harder to organize sessions. I tried sneaking it into my navy camp once and got caught in like a week lol.

So I built this, first as a singleplayer version just to entertain myself by playing with bots following simple logic flow charts. 

But I have plans to make it multiplayer to play with friends online, although it still won't be the same as in person of course. 

Training the bots using machine learning and deep learning techniques is also in the works, hopefully to make bridge bots that are unbeatable (or at least very hard to beat since bridge is still has an element of luck) like chess bots have become.
